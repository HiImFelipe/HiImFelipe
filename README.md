<p>
I recommend checking the projects that I give stars to. They are mostly from applications that frequently use, and also people that I support.

#### üïπÔ∏è Interests:

- **Linux Ecosystem**
  - I often try different OSes and I have set up many Linux environments for the past few years. I absolutely love messing around with **Arch**, but I respect System76's work with the **Pop!OS** project a lot.
  - I have tried WSL 2 while using windows 11 in the past. It is fine, I tried to run Ubuntu alongside because I wasn't really experienced with linux. The only downside is the memory overhead that it causes.
- **Programming Frameworks**
  - As a **JavaScript/TypeScript** developer, I ran many **React**-based frameworks like **Next** and **Vite**, also other front-end alternatives like **Svelte**. But my interest peaks when we are talking about back-end frameworks like **NestJS**.
- **Learning other languages**
  - You might have noticed that this page is written in english, but I don't speak it natively. It is an endless effort to stay in touch with another language and it is something that I personally enjoy a lot. It's been over three years since I am able to watch videos fully in english and interact with others worldwide, it's another world completely.
